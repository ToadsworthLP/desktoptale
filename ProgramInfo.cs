You can control your character by clicking it and using W/A/S/D or the arrow keys to move, X or Shift to run, Z or Space to trigger a mouse click where they are standing (left click by default, right click while holding Shift) and C to play a special animation (if available).
For more options such as changing or adding characters, right click on a character to open the menu.

Would you like to automatically open saved preset files (.dt) with this installation in the future? (This can be done at any time from Settings > Associate Preset Files)
